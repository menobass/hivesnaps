echo "Analysis:"
echo "========="
echo "The fingerprints don't match. This could mean:"
echo "1. Google Play Console is using 'App signing by Google Play'"
echo "   - In this case, the SHA1 shown in Google Play is the app signing certificate"
echo "   - The EAS keystore is the upload certificate"
echo "   - This is the RECOMMENDED setup"
echo ""
echo "2. The keystore was regenerated since last upload"
echo "   - This would require updating the app in Google Play Console"
echo ""
echo "3. Different Google Play project or app"
echo ""
echo "NEXT STEPS:"
echo "==========="
echo "1. Check Google Play Console > App integrity > App signing"
echo "2. Look for 'Upload certificate' vs 'App signing certificate'"
echo "3. If using Google Play App Signing, compare with upload certificate"
echo "4. If not using Google Play App Signing, may need to create new release"
