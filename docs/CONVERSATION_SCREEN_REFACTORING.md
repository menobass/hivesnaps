# ConversationScreen Refactoring

## Problem

The original `ConversationScreen.tsx` was a massive **2,843-line monolithic component** with tightly coupled business logic and UI concerns. This made it:

- **Hard to maintain** - Changes to business logic required touching UI code
- **Difficult to test** - Business logic was embedded in the component
- **Hard to reuse** - Logic couldn't be shared with other components
- **Complex to debug** - All state and logic in one place
- **Performance issues** - Large component with many re-renders

## Solution: Custom Hooks Architecture

We refactored the component using **custom React hooks** to separate concerns:

### 1. **useConversationData** - Data Fetching & Management
```typescript
const {
  snap,
  replies,
  loading,
  error,
  refreshConversation
} = useConversationData(author, permlink, currentUsername);
```

**Responsibilities:**
- Fetch snap and replies data from Hive blockchain
- Manage loading and error states
- Handle avatar caching and enhancement
- Recursive reply tree fetching
- Data refresh functionality

### 2. **useReply** - Reply Functionality
```typescript
const {
  replyModalVisible,
  replyText,
  replyImage,
  replyGif,
  posting,
  openReplyModal,
  submitReply,
  addImage,
  addGif
} = useReply(currentUsername);
```

**Responsibilities:**
- Reply modal state management
- Image and GIF upload handling
- Reply submission to blockchain
- Error handling for replies

### 3. **useEdit** - Edit Functionality
```typescript
const {
  editModalVisible,
  editText,
  editImage,
  editGif,
  editing,
  openEditModal,
  submitEdit,
  addImage,
  addGif
} = useEdit(currentUsername);
```

**Responsibilities:**
- Edit modal state management
- Content editing for snaps and replies
- Image and GIF handling for edits
- Edit submission to blockchain

### 4. **useGifPicker** - GIF Selection
```typescript
const {
  gifModalVisible,
  gifSearchQuery,
  gifResults,
  gifLoading,
  openGifPicker,
  searchGifs,
  selectGif
} = useGifPicker();
```

**Responsibilities:**
- GIF picker modal state
- Tenor API integration
- GIF search and selection
- Modal management

### 5. **Reused Hooks**
- **useUserAuth** - User authentication state
- **useUpvote** - Voting functionality
- **useHiveData** - Hive blockchain data

## Benefits

### âœ… **Separation of Concerns**
- **UI Component**: Only handles rendering and user interactions
- **Custom Hooks**: Handle business logic and state management
- **Clear boundaries** between presentation and logic

### âœ… **Reusability**
- Hooks can be used in other components
- Logic is not tied to specific UI implementation
- Easy to share functionality across screens

### âœ… **Testability**
- Each hook can be tested independently
- Business logic is isolated from UI
- Easier to mock dependencies

### âœ… **Maintainability**
- **Smaller, focused components** (from 2,843 to ~800 lines)
- **Clear responsibility boundaries**
- **Easier to locate and fix issues**

### âœ… **Performance**
- **Optimized re-renders** - Only relevant state changes trigger updates
- **Better caching** - Data fetching logic is optimized
- **Reduced bundle size** - No duplicate logic

### âœ… **Developer Experience**
- **Easier to understand** - Each hook has a single responsibility
- **Better debugging** - State is co-located with logic
- **Faster development** - Reusable patterns

## Code Comparison

### Before (Monolithic)
```typescript
// 2,843 lines of mixed concerns
const ConversationScreen = () => {
  // 50+ useState calls
  const [snap, setSnap] = useState(null);
  const [replies, setReplies] = useState([]);
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);
  // ... 47 more state variables

  // 20+ useEffect hooks
  useEffect(() => {
    // Complex data fetching logic
  }, [dependencies]);

  // 15+ handler functions
  const handleSubmitReply = async () => {
    // 50+ lines of business logic
  };

  // 10+ render functions
  const renderReplyTree = (reply, level) => {
    // Complex rendering logic
  };

  return (
    // 500+ lines of JSX
  );
};
```

### After (Hooks-based)
```typescript
// ~800 lines focused on UI
const ConversationScreenRefactored = () => {
  // Clean hook usage
  const { snap, replies, loading } = useConversationData(author, permlink, currentUsername);
  const { replyModalVisible, submitReply } = useReply(currentUsername);
  const { editModalVisible, submitEdit } = useEdit(currentUsername);
  const { gifModalVisible, searchGifs } = useGifPicker();

  // Simple event handlers
  const handleUpvotePress = ({ author, permlink }) => {
    openUpvoteModal({ author, permlink });
  };

  // Focused render functions
  const renderReplyTree = (reply, level) => {
    // Pure UI rendering
  };

  return (
    // Clean JSX focused on layout
  );
};
```

## File Structure

```
hooks/
â”œâ”€â”€ useConversationData.ts    # Data fetching & management
â”œâ”€â”€ useReply.ts              # Reply functionality
â”œâ”€â”€ useEdit.ts               # Edit functionality
â”œâ”€â”€ useGifPicker.ts          # GIF selection
â”œâ”€â”€ useUserAuth.ts           # User authentication (reused)
â”œâ”€â”€ useUpvote.ts             # Voting (reused)
â””â”€â”€ useHiveData.ts           # Hive data (reused)

app/
â”œâ”€â”€ ConversationScreen.tsx           # Original (2,843 lines)
â””â”€â”€ ConversationScreenRefactored.tsx # Refactored (~800 lines)
```

## Migration Strategy

1. **Create custom hooks** for each major functionality
2. **Test hooks independently** to ensure they work correctly
3. **Gradually replace** business logic in component with hook calls
4. **Simplify component** to focus only on UI rendering
5. **Update imports** and remove unused code
6. **Test thoroughly** to ensure functionality is preserved

## Future Improvements

### ðŸš€ **Additional Hooks**
- **useImageUpload** - Centralized image upload logic
- **useMarkdownProcessing** - Text processing utilities
- **useNavigation** - Navigation logic abstraction

### ðŸš€ **Performance Optimizations**
- **Memoization** of expensive computations
- **Virtual scrolling** for large reply trees
- **Image lazy loading** and caching

### ðŸš€ **Testing**
- **Unit tests** for each custom hook
- **Integration tests** for hook combinations
- **E2E tests** for complete user flows

### ðŸš€ **State Management**
- **Context providers** for shared state if needed
- **Optimistic updates** for better UX
- **Offline support** with local caching

## Conclusion

The refactoring successfully **separated business logic from UI concerns**, making the codebase:

- **More maintainable** - Clear separation of responsibilities
- **More testable** - Isolated, focused units of logic
- **More reusable** - Hooks can be shared across components
- **More performant** - Optimized re-renders and data fetching
- **Easier to understand** - Each piece has a single responsibility

This pattern can be applied to other large components in the app, creating a consistent and scalable architecture.
